Dear Developer,

You have to edit two files to run the WNS from within your Eclipse IDE.

1) The web.xml
Change the value of
'<param-value>E:/workspace/52nWNS/WebContent/WEB-INF/conf/config.xml</param-value>'
to the path of your workspace!

2) The config.xml can be found in the folder conf

Edit the value for
<WNSURL>http://localhost:8080/52nWNS/wns</WNSURL>
to your host url

Edit the values for the database connection of
<user>admin</user>
<password></password>
<URL>localhost:8080/exist</URL>
to your values

Edit the path of the wns.wsdl file
<WSDLDocumentPath>E:/workspace/52nWNS/WebContent/WEB-INF/conf/wns.wsdl</WSDLDocumentPath>
to your path

Edit the <RegisteredHandlers> to your needs. If any handler should not be used then
delete it or comment it out!!!
