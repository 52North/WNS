RELEASE NOTES

Main functions
========================

 The Web Notification Service acts as a protocol transducer.
 The WNS is able to register SingelUser and MultiUser. A SingleUser 
 is a user with a name and one or more protocols. A Multi user is 
 a group of SingleUser.
 The WNS can send messages. A notification 
 should just notify the user that something happened. A communication message
 will show the user where the user can interact with the calling service.
 If a user is registered to SMS, FAX or PHONE the WNS will store the complete 
 message and will only provide a short message of the message, a messageID and 
 the URL where to get the complete message. If the user is registered to email,
 http or xmpp the message will be delivered completely.
 
 To setup the WNS please refer to the installation guide, found in the documentation folder
 
Release 52n-wns-2.1.0-SNAPSHOT
==============================
- Switch to a Maven managed project
- Dropped project hosted xsd files. Now 52n-xml-wns-v009 dependency is being selected
  automatically from Maven
- Change namespace http://www.52north.org/wns/ to http://www.52north.org/wns/v2 to 
  make it version dependend
 
Release 52n-sensorweb-wns-v2-00-01
==================================
- Added provider element to e-mail handler. This enables the user to change the mailhandler at runtime.
- Added DebugMode switch to wns config to en/disable ListWNSUser request.
- Added namespace to XML data type XMLHashMap
- Added new test client v2.0 using javascript and code highlighting
- Fixed BUG 511. Internally, java.lang.Long user ids are used
- Fixed BUG 513. 

Release 52N-WNS-RFC
=========================
- Updated implementation to reflect WNS RFC package contents. The schema
  bindings had to be updated.
- We changed the type of sms/phone/fax numbers in XML schema from integer to
  token so that the WNS now preserves leading zeros in requests.

Release 52N-WNS-v2-00-00
=========================
- According to OGC best practice paper 06-095 the WNS has lost the operation
  doCommunication
- The compile settings were changed to the new SUN JAVA 6.0, but the version 5.0
  should work also
- Now it is possible to add MultiUser to other MultiUser. By allowing this
  a circular dependency could occur during adding new MultiUser. To prevent
  this dependency the WNS checks now the new MultiUser if these dependencies
  can occur before the user will be added
- Bug fix: If you unregister a SingleUser this user will be now removed from
  every MultiUser. The bug was that the user document was not be updated, but
  the internal datastructure removed the SingleUser from every MultiUser
  
  

Development Snapshot 52nWNS-2006-1212-CVS
=========================
- Major bug fixes
- Due to some SMTP servers the email sending doesn't worked in the previously
  release. Java released a new JAVA MAIL Api, which allows easy SSL sending and it
  is easy to switch the connection mode to TLS.
- The DAO's use now completely the eXist database to store messages and the user document
- The ability to log errors were integrated, it uses the log4J api

Known Bugs:
- In some cases the SMTP server connection doesn't work. A known server which 
  shows this error is:
  				secmail.uni-muenster.de
  Please tell me other servers that doesn't work with this snapshot.
